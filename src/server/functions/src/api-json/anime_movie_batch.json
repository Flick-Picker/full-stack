He has no interest in others and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, titled Living with Dying.

She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day.

She daydreams about the outside world, but dares not travel from her home due to the warnings of the clan's chief.\n\nOne day however, the outside world finds her, as the power-hungry kingdom of Mezarte invades her homeland.

One thing is for certain though: the undeniable friendships these girls have formed is something that will carry on long after the final scene rolls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The movie won the Feature Film Award in the 17th Animation Kobe Awards in 2012 and the 2012 Newtype Anime Awards for Best Anime Film.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":929,"type":"anime","name":"Animation Do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/929/Animation_Do"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3784,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3784/Evangelion__20_You_Can_Not_Advance","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74983l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ncZ9Vd4YYFk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncZ9Vd4YYFk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncZ9Vd4YYFk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncZ9Vd4YYFk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncZ9Vd4YYFk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncZ9Vd4YYFk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncZ9Vd4YYFk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncZ9Vd4YYFk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Evangelion Shin Gekijouban: Ha"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Rebuild of Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Evangelion 2.22"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ヱヴァンゲリヲン新劇場版:破"},{"type":"English","title":"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance"},{"type":"German","title":"Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (not) Advance"},{"type":"French","title":"Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance"}],"title":"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance","title_english":"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance","title_japanese":"ヱヴァンゲリヲン新劇場版:破","title_synonyms":["Evangelion Shin Gekijouban: Ha","Rebuild of Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance","Evangelion 2.22"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":7,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 27, 2009"},"duration":"1 hr 52 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":8.31,"scored_by":307987,"rank":235,"popularity":391,"members":502852,"favorites":3311,"synopsis":"When the threat of the Angel menace escalates, mankind's defense force is pushed to its limits, with NERV at the forefront of the struggle.

Against a roster full of nationally-ranked players, the former flightless crows will have to use everything in their arsenal if they want to represent Miyagi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":34537,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34537/Yoru_wa_Mijikashi_Arukeyo_Otome","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86940l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"tmeU9GFJW3I","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeU9GFJW3I","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmeU9GFJW3I?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tmeU9GFJW3I/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tmeU9GFJW3I/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tmeU9GFJW3I/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tmeU9GFJW3I/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tmeU9GFJW3I/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Night Is Short"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Walk on Girl"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"夜は短し歩けよ乙女"},{"type":"English","title":"The Night is Short, Walk on Girl"},{"type":"German","title":"Night is Short, Walk On Girl"},{"type":"French","title":"Night is Short, Walk on Girl"}],"title":"Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome","title_english":"The Night is Short, Walk on Girl","title_japanese":"夜は短し歩けよ乙女","title_synonyms":["The Night Is Short","Walk on Girl"],"type":"Movie","source":"Novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":4,"year":2017},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 7, 2017"},"duration":"1 hr 32 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":8.19,"scored_by":46464,"rank":359,"popularity":1692,"members":114524,"favorites":1570,"synopsis":"On a mysterious night that seems to last for a year, an ordinary college student continues to chase one of his underclassmen, a girl with black hair—the girl of his dreams.

As the situations become dire, Akihito must fight to protect himself, his closest friends, and Mirai—the bespectacled beauty he holds most dear. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4107,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4107/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann_Movie_1__Gurren-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1270/115752l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"SXg9mvnUWsM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXg9mvnUWsM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXg9mvnUWsM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SXg9mvnUWsM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SXg9mvnUWsM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SXg9mvnUWsM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SXg9mvnUWsM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SXg9mvnUWsM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Movie 1: Gurren-hen"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Gekijouban Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Guren-hen"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann the Movie"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"劇場版 天元突破グレンラガン 紅蓮篇"},{"type":"English","title":"Gurren Lagann The Movie: Childhood's End"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Gurren Lagann: El Fin de la Infancia"}],"title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Movie 1: Gurren-hen","title_english":"Gurren Lagann The Movie: Childhood's End","title_japanese":"劇場版 天元突破グレンラガン 紅蓮篇","title_synonyms":["Gekijouban Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Guren-hen","Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann the Movie"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":9,"year":2008},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 6, 2008"},"duration":"1 hr 52 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.16,"scored_by":77568,"rank":385,"popularity":1350,"members":155326,"favorites":386,"synopsis":"Animation studio Gainax presented a website for the release of a movie adaptation of the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann TV series in the fall of 2008.

Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. The film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite – Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle. In 2014 it won the Animation of the Year during the Japan Academy Prize, the Best Animated Film during the National Board of Review and the Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media during the Satellite Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Disney Platform Distribution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Disney_Platform_Distribution"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4155,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4155/One_Piece_Film__Strong_World","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1192/116784l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"3n58UPvcD7I","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n58UPvcD7I","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3n58UPvcD7I?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3n58UPvcD7I/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3n58UPvcD7I/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3n58UPvcD7I/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3n58UPvcD7I/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3n58UPvcD7I/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece Film: Strong World"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"One Piece Movie 10"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ワンピース　フィルム　ストロングワールド"},{"type":"English","title":"One Piece Film: Strong World"},{"type":"German","title":"One Piece Film 10: Strong World"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"One Piece Película 10: Strong World"},{"type":"French","title":"One Piece Film 10: Strong World"}],"title":"One Piece Film: Strong World","title_english":"One Piece Film: Strong World","title_japanese":"ワンピース　フィルム　ストロングワールド","title_synonyms":["One Piece Movie 10"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":12,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 12, 2009"},"duration":"1 hr 55 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.09,"scored_by":145658,"rank":465,"popularity":921,"members":232443,"favorites":440,"synopsis":"Upon hearing news that islands in East Blue are being destroyed, Monkey D.

Now enrolled at the same school as his idol, he attempts to join the volleyball team despite his short stature. Unfortunately, upon his arrival, Hinata locks eyes with \"King of the Court\" Tobio Kageyama—a genius setter whom he had once suffered a bitter defeat to in middle school.\n\nTheir unfriendly introduction and subsequent rivalry forces the rest of the Karasuno team to bar both of them from joining the club until they can learn to work together as teammates.

Lelouch's malicious plans are unexpectedly accelerated upon meeting the mysterious woman C.C., who grants him a supernatural ability known as \"Geass\" that makes anyone Lelouch commands unable to defy his will. \n\nNow armed with a devastating power, Lelouch assumes the persona of Zero, a revolutionary figure who carries the hopes and dreams of the oppressed around the world. He vows to restore the glorious nation of Japan and deliver divine retribution to Britannia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The movie premiered in Japan on October 21, 2017 at 79 theatres nationwide.

Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st is a retelling of the original series, which tells the story of two young mages and how their strong emotions shape their actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Seven Arcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/35/Seven_Arcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":12113,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12113/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_II_-_Doldrey_Kouryaku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/37193l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"0zEbyF6NuAw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zEbyF6NuAw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zEbyF6NuAw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0zEbyF6NuAw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0zEbyF6NuAw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0zEbyF6NuAw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0zEbyF6NuAw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0zEbyF6NuAw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen II - Doldrey Kouryaku"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Berserk Movie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Berserk Saga"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ベルセルク 黄金時代篇Ⅱ ドルドレイ攻略"},{"type":"English","title":"Berserk: The Golden Age Arc II - The Battle for Doldrey"},{"type":"German","title":"Berserk: Das goldene Zeitalter II"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Berserk: La Edad de Oro II.

Seirin's \"light and shadow\" duo, Taiga Kagami and Tetsuya Kuroko, now find themselves given the ultimate test of teamwork in which they must play with the strongest synergy possible to break through Akashi's omniscience. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":1366,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1366/Detective_Conan_Movie_07__Crossroad_in_the_Ancient_Capital","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/20984l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Detective Conan Movie 07: Crossroad in the Ancient Capital"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Meitantei Conan: Meikyuu no Crossroad"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"名探偵コナン 迷宮の十字路(クロスロード)"},{"type":"German","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 7: Die Kreuzung des Labyrinths"},{"type":"French","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 7: Croisement dans l'ancienne capitale"}],"title":"Detective Conan Movie 07: Crossroad in the Ancient Capital","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"名探偵コナン 迷宮の十字路(クロスロード)","title_synonyms":["Meitantei Conan: Meikyuu no Crossroad"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":4,"year":2003},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 19, 2003"},"duration":"1 hr 48 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.8,"scored_by":29002,"rank":905,"popularity":2857,"members":48839,"favorites":33,"synopsis":"Under the cover of darkness, a masked samurai murders five men across the metropolis of Japan: three in Tokyo, one in Osaka, and the last in Kyoto.

As he waits for his father's return, Takumi begins to feel his itch to race grow ever more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"New Initial D Movie: Legend 2 - Tousou was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sentai Filmworks on March 13, 2018.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Ultra Super Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":537,"type":"anime","name":"SANZIGEN","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/537/SANZIGEN"},{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":4447,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4447/Detective_Conan_Movie_12__Full_Score_of_Fear","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Detective Conan Movie 12: Full Score of Fear"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Meitantei Conan: Senritsu no Gakufu [Full Score]"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Detective Conan 2008"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Detective Conan movie 12"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"名探偵コナン 戦慄の楽譜（フルスコア）"},{"type":"German","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 12: Die Partitur des Grauens"},{"type":"French","title":"Détective Conan Film 12: La mélodie de la Peur"}],"title":"Detective Conan Movie 12: Full Score of Fear","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"名探偵コナン 戦慄の楽譜（フルスコア）","title_synonyms":["Meitantei Conan: Senritsu no Gakufu [Full Score]","Detective Conan 2008","Detective Conan movie 12"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 19, 2008"},"duration":"1 hr 56 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.79,"scored_by":25766,"rank":940,"popularity":3009,"members":44526,"favorites":20,"synopsis":"Serial murders involving all kinds have happened.

With a new outlook on life and knowledge of how the Yakuza are going to attack him, Nishi kills one of the Yakuza with his own gun, fleeing in a stolen car with Myon and her sister.\n\nAcclaimed director Masaaki Yuasa's debut film, Mind Game's constantly shifting visuals tell a story about living one's life without regrets that is unlike any other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The film was awarded the Animation Division Grand Prize at the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival.

Resolving to defeat this phantom, Keisuke mobilizes the Akagi Red Suns to take on the local Akina Speed Stars racing team in an exchange race. He anticipates that the competition will lure the elusive \"Ghost of Akina\" out into the open and give him the opportunity to exact revenge for his previous defeat. \n\nWhile his friend Itsuki Takeuchi is obsessed with cars and racing, Takumi Fujiwara is not. He fails to understand the \"rush\" that racers experience and any talk of cars reminds him of the tofu deliveries he makes for his father in an old AE86. His early morning routine takes him up and down Mount Akina, where he has memorized every hairpin, brake point, and turn better than anyone else. \n\nWhen the Akagi team appears one night to challenge the Speed Stars to an exchange race, they accept the challenge only to find out that they are completely outclassed. The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team. With a bit of coercion, Takumi takes the wheel of the AE86 and heads off to Mount Akina to defend the pride of all racers in Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"New Initial D Movie: Legend 1 -

As Shiki begins opening up to him, Mikiya learns about her unique upbringing.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of unprecedented murders takes place across Mifune City.

One day, she saves Prince Lune of the Cat Kingdom from being run over by a truck. As a token of gratitude, the Cat King sends her \"presents\" and invites her to the Cat Kingdom to become Lune's wife. Haru's inability to properly communicate with the cats leads to the misunderstanding that she has accepted the proposal.\n\nAs Haru ponders on ways to escape the predicament, a mysterious voice instructs her to search for the Cat Bureau. However, not long after she finally arrives at the bureau, a horde of cats swarms in and forcibly takes her to the Cat Kingdom, along with a member of the Cat Bureau. Concerned for their safety, owner of the Cat Bureau, Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, follows close behind.\n\nThe more Haru immerses herself in the activities of the Cat Kingdom, the more cat-like she becomes. To her dismay, she soon learns that, unless she can find her true self, she may become a cat permanently. Haru's adventures in the world of cats lead her down a path to self-discovery, allowing her to return as a more confident person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Cat Returns is a spin-off of the movie Whisper of the Heart, and although some characters are crossed over, the stories in the two films are not related. Studio Ghibli began work on the movie as the 20 minute \"Cat Project\" in 1999 for a theme park in Japan. Although the theme park canceled the project, the 20 minute short film turned into a 45 minute project, and then a feature length film. The movie was the second Studio Ghibli film to be directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. It won an Excellence Prize at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival.

She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is an anime adaption of Yoru Sumino's novel of the same title.

With the sign of an unexpected friendship blooming on the horizon, the girls waste no time diving into their ambitious sightseeing plans and regional activities!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": { "day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "CGDCT", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT" }, { "mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 523, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/523/Tonari_no_Totoro", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75923l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "92a7Hj0ijLs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92a7Hj0ijLs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/92a7Hj0ijLs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/92a7Hj0ijLs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/92a7Hj0ijLs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/92a7Hj0ijLs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/92a7Hj0ijLs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/92a7Hj0ijLs/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Tonari no Totoro" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "My Neighbour Totoro" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "となりのトトロ" }, { "type": "English", "title": "My Neighbor Totoro" }, { "type": "German", "title": "Mein Nachbar Totoro" }, { "type": "Spanish", "title": "Mi Vecino Totoro" }, { "type": "French", "title": "Mon Voisin Totoro" }], "title": "Tonari no Totoro", "title_english": "My Neighbor Totoro", "title_japanese": "となりのトトロ", "title_synonyms": ["My Neighbour Totoro"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "1988-04-16T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": { "from": { "day": 16, "month": 4, "year": 1988 }, "to": { "day": null, "month": null, "year": null } }, "string": "Apr 16, 1988" }, "duration": "1 hr 26 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 8.25, "scored_by": 638819, "rank": 291, "popularity": 143, "members": 980040, "favorites": 7712, "synopsis": "In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, to the countryside to be closer to their mother, who is hospitalized due to long-term illness.

Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. The film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite – Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle.

When he inspects the movement logs in her database, a cryptic line grabs his attention: \"Are you enjoying the time of EVE?\" Accompanied by his friend Masakazu Masaki, Rikuo tracks the whereabouts of his houseroid to a cafe called Time of Eve, where it is forbidden for customers to display prejudice against one another. The cafe, Rikuo realizes, is frequented by both man and machine, with no evidence to tell either apart.\n\nEach customer—from the cheerful Akiko, to a robot dangerously close to breaking down—has their own story and challenges to overcome. While Rikuo tries to reveal Sammy's intentions, he begins to question the legitimacy of the fear that drives humans to regard androids as nothing more than mere tools.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": { "day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 324, "type": "anime", "name": "Directions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/324/Directions" }, { "mal_id": 325, "type": "anime", "name": "Code", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/325/Code" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 595, "type": "anime", "name": "NYAV Post", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post" }, { "mal_id": 1467, "type": "anime", "name": "Pied Piper", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1467/Pied_Piper" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 84, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Rikka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/84/Studio_Rikka" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi" }, { "mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [] }, { "mal_id": 29755, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/29755/Haikyuu_Movie_1__Owari_to_Hajimari", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/76011l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "-O1um6NXC5M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O1um6NXC5M", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-O1um6NXC5M?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-O1um6NXC5M/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-O1um6NXC5M/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-O1um6NXC5M/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-O1um6NXC5M/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-O1um6NXC5M/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Haikyuu!!

A bloody Kaitou Kid announcement card is found in the crime scene.\n\nIn the meantime, Ran and Sonoko have come to Singapore to see a karate tournament held there. Conan, who doesn't have a passport and can't travel overseas, was supposed to stay at home. But Kid, who wants to make use of him, uses a magical trick to forcibly drag him to Singapore. Conan must obey Kid if he wants to get back to Japan, gets his glasses, wristwatch and clothes, amongst others, all stolen from him and he has to disguise himself.\n\nRan, who doesn't realize who he is, asks him his name and he improvises the name Arthur Hirai. Kid eventually gets a hold of information about the \"fist\" being stored in a manor's underground vault. Just when he was thinking that he'd made it inside very easily, he finds a dangerous trap awaiting him. Facing him is the strongest karateka with 400 consecutive victories: Makoto Kyogoku.\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)", "background": "As of 7 July 2019, the film has grossed ¥9.1 billion ($82,409,621) domestically, making it one of the top 50 highest-grossing films ever in Japan.

Angered by Alois' closeness to a peasant, her father sends her away to a school in Antwerp to prevent them from meeting again. \n\nWhile continuing his daily market runs, Nello stumbles upon an art contest surrounding the famous Peter Paul Rubens—a Flemish artist he holds in high regard. Not only does the contest offer a monetary prize, but it also comes with the opportunity to study art at a school in the same city Alois is studying.

Haunted by memories of Char's Rebellion, Hathaway leads a dissident faction of his own known as Mafty. He adopts the alias \"Mafty Navue Erin\" and commits acts of violence in revolt against the growing tyranny of the Federation.\n\nAfter thwarting the hostile takeover of a plane by a terrorist group fraudulently claiming to be Mafty, Hathaway's secret identity is discovered by a young woman named Gigi Andalucia. Hathaway befriends both Gigi and Federation colonel Kenneth Sleg, but his double life endangers them as the armed conflict between Mafty and the Federation comes to a head.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": { "day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null }, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action" }, { "mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama" }, { "mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha" }, { "mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military" }, { "mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space" }], "demographics": [] }, { "mal_id": 24921, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/24921/Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio__Ars_Nova_Movie_2_-_Cadenza", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74665l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "jowPbXcznWU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jowPbXcznWU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jowPbXcznWU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jowPbXcznWU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jowPbXcznWU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jowPbXcznWU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jowPbXcznWU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jowPbXcznWU/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Movie 2 - Cadenza" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Cadenza" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova Movie 2" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Gekijouban Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "劇場版 蒼き鋼のアルペジオ ‐アルス・ノヴァ‐ Cadenza" }], "title": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Movie 2 - Cadenza", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "劇場版 蒼き鋼のアルペジオ ‐アルス・ノヴァ‐ Cadenza", "title_synonyms": ["Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Cadenza", "Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova Movie 2", "Gekijouban Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2015-10-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": { "from": { "day": 3, "month": 10, "year": 2015 }, "to": { "day": null, "month": null, "year": null } }, "string": "Oct 3, 2015" }, "duration": "1 hr 45 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.83, "scored_by": 12216, "rank": 857, "popularity": 3691, "members": 30161, "favorites": 122, "synopsis": "The group of privateers known as the Blue Steel continues their mission to deliver blueprints of the Vibration Warhead Torpedo—a weapon that may turn the tides of war in their favor—to the United States.

In their investigation, the police learn that each man was a member of the Genjibotaru—a thieves gang centered on the theft of Buddhist statues and artifacts and who go by the names of Minomoto no Yoshitune's servants.\n \nWithout a clear motive or clues to the other members' identities, the case runs dry until a Kyoto temple calls for the famous Kogorou Mouri. Having received an anonymous letter containing a peculiar puzzle, the temple monks ask for his assistance in solving it to recover their long lost statue. Meanwhile, Conan Edogawa and high school detective Heiji Hattori team up in order to solve the cryptic puzzle and find the murderer, as Hattori searches for his childhood love.\n \nWith Hattori's knowledge of Kyoto, the two scour the streets and gradually discover the truth, but not before the murderer strikes again—killing another Genjibotaru member and, after repeated attempts on Hattori's life, eventually kidnapping Hattori's childhood sweetheart. It is only by working together to bring buried clues to light can Conan and Hattori hope to end the rogue samurai's bloodshed and save Hattori's love.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": { "day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null }, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 73, "type": "anime", "name": "TMS Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure" }, { "mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy" }, { "mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen" }] }, { "mal_id": 451, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/451/InuYasha_Movie_3__Tenka_Hadou_no_Ken", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1658/95332l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": { "image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "InuYasha Movie 3: Tenka Hadou no Ken" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Inu Yasha: Tenka Hadou no Ken" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "InuYasha: The Sword of the World Conquest" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "The Sword That Rules Over the Empires" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "映画 犬夜叉 天下覇道の剣" }, { "type": "English", "title": "InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler" }, { "type": "German", "title": "InuYasha Film 2: Swords of an Honorable Ruler" }, { "type": "Spanish", "title": "Inuyasha Película 3: La Espada Conquistadora" }], "title": "InuYasha Movie 3: Tenka Hadou no Ken", "title_english": "InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler", "title_japanese": "映画 犬夜叉 天下覇道の剣", "title_synonyms": ["Inu Yasha: Tenka Hadou no Ken", "InuYasha: The Sword of the World Conquest", "The Sword That Rules Over the Empires"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2003-12-20T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": { "from": { "day": 20, "month": 12, "year": 2003 }, "to": { "day": null, "month": null, "year": null } }, "string": "Dec 20, 2003" }, "duration": "1 hr 38 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.8, "scored_by": 51637, "rank": 911, "popularity": 1917, "members": 96707, "favorites": 203, "synopsis": "Following Inu no Taishou's death, his swords Tenseiga and Tessaiga were passed on to his sons, Sesshoumaru and Inuyasha respectively.

Overseeing the dilemma, Takumi's employer goads him into accepting. However, when Takumi returns home to get the AE86, he finds that his father has taken the car out for himself. As he waits for his father's return, Takumi begins to feel his itch to race grow ever more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "New Initial D Movie: Legend 2 - Tousou was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sentai Filmworks on March 13, 2018.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": { "day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku" }, { "mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha" }, { "mal_id": 539, "type": "anime", "name": "Ultra Super Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures" }, { "mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures" }, { "mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 537, "type": "anime", "name": "SANZIGEN", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/537/SANZIGEN" }, { "mal_id": 839, "type": "anime", "name": "LIDENFILMS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS" }], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 4447, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4447/Detective_Conan_Movie_12__Full_Score_of_Fear", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22766l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": { "image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Detective Conan Movie 12: Full Score of Fear" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Meitantei Conan: Senritsu no Gakufu [Full Score]" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Detective Conan 2008" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Detective Conan movie 12" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "名探偵コナン 戦慄の楽譜（フルスコア）" }, { "type": "German", "title": "Detektiv Conan Film 12: Die Partitur des Grauens" }, { "type": "French", "title": "Détective Conan Film 12: La mélodie de la Peur" }], "title": "Detective Conan Movie 12: Full Score of Fear", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "名探偵コナン 戦慄の楽譜（フルスコア）", "title_synonyms": ["Meitantei Conan: Senritsu no Gakufu [Full Score]", "Detective Conan 2008", "Detective Conan movie 12"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2008-04-19T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": { "from": { "day": 19, "month": 4, "year": 2008 }, "to": { "day": null, "month": null, "year": null } }, "string": "Apr 19, 2008" }, "duration": "1 hr 56 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.79, "scored_by": 25766, "rank": 940, "popularity": 3009, "members": 44526, "favorites": 20, "synopsis": "Serial murders involving all kinds have happened.

The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team.

As Shiki begins opening up to him, Mikiya learns about her unique upbringing.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of unprecedented murders takes place across Mifune City.

Haru's inability to properly communicate with the cats leads to the misunderstanding that she has accepted the proposal.\n\nAs Haru ponders on ways to escape the predicament, a mysterious voice instructs her to search for the Cat Bureau.

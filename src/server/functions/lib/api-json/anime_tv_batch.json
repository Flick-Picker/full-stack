With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\n\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "spring", "year": 2015, "broadcast": { "day": "Wednesdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo" }, { "mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex" }, { "mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation" }, { "mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 1258, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1258/Bandai_Namco_Pictures" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action" }, { "mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy" }, { "mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor" }, { "mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical" }, { "mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody" }, { "mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen" }] }, { "mal_id": 43608, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/43608/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Ultra_Romantic", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "vFN5K-iAyV0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFN5K-iAyV0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFN5K-iAyV0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 3rd Season" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3rd Season" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "かぐや様は告らせたい-ウルトラロマンティック-" }, { "type": "English", "title": "Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic" }], "title": "Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic", "title_english": "Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic", "title_japanese": "かぐや様は告らせたい-ウルトラロマンティック-", "title_synonyms": ["Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 3rd Season", "Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3rd Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2022-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 2022 }, "to": { "day": 25, "month": 6, "year": 2022 } }, "string": "Apr 9, 2022 to Jun 25, 2022" }, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 9.07, "scored_by": 401287, "rank": 5, "popularity": 228, "members": 751191, "favorites": 26989, "synopsis": "The elite members of Shuchiin Academy's student council continue their competitive day-to-day antics.

While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.\n\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. \n\nNine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "spring", "year": 2004, "broadcast": { "day": "Wednesdays", "time": "00:40", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 00:40 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP" }, { "mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions" }, { "mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 119, "type": "anime", "name": "VIZ Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama" }, { "mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery" }, { "mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast" }, { "mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 47778, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/47778/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba__Yuukaku-hen", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/120036l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "QwvWdnd2Ktg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvWdnd2Ktg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwvWdnd2Ktg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/QwvWdnd2Ktg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/QwvWdnd2Ktg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/QwvWdnd2Ktg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/QwvWdnd2Ktg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/QwvWdnd2Ktg/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "鬼滅の刃 遊郭編" }, { "type": "English", "title": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc" }], "title": "Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen", "title_english": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc", "title_japanese": "鬼滅の刃 遊郭編", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 11, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2021-12-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-02-13T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 5, "month": 12, "year": 2021 }, "to": { "day": 13, "month": 2, "year": 2022 } }, "string": "Dec 5, 2021 to Feb 13, 2022" }, "duration": "26 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.82, "scored_by": 686932, "rank": 26, "popularity": 108, "members": 1129794, "favorites": 22495, "synopsis": "The devastation of the Mugen Train incident still weighs heavily on the members of the Demon Slayer Corps.

This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since.

The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei Lü continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people—but Lü is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, Lü slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kingdom 4th Season was released on Blu-ray in three volumes from August 26, 2022 to November 25, 2022.", "season": "spring", "year": 2022, "broadcast": { "day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures" }, { "mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha" }, { "mal_id": 1797, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises" }], "licensors": [], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Pierrot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot" }, { "mal_id": 1998, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Signpost", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1998/Studio_Signpost" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical" }, { "mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 37521, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37521/Vinland_Saga", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1500/103005l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "f8JrZ7Q_p-8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8JrZ7Q_p-8", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8JrZ7Q_p-8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8JrZ7Q_p-8/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8JrZ7Q_p-8/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8JrZ7Q_p-8/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8JrZ7Q_p-8/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8JrZ7Q_p-8/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Vinland Saga" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "ヴィンランド・サガ" }], "title": "Vinland Saga", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "ヴィンランド・サガ", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2019-07-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-12-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 8, "month": 7, "year": 2019 }, "to": { "day": 30, "month": 12, "year": 2019 } }, "string": "Jul 8, 2019 to Dec 30, 2019" }, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.73, "scored_by": 705059, "rank": 42, "popularity": 90, "members": 1268057, "favorites": 38792, "synopsis": "Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland.

War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father.

Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "spring", "year": 2014, "broadcast": { "day": "Saturdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex" }, { "mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha" }, { "mal_id": 711, "type": "anime", "name": "Delfi Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Artland", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure" }, { "mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy" }, { "mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery" }, { "mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life" }, { "mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast" }, { "mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical" }, { "mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 46102, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/46102/Odd_Taxi", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "rS228HesD9g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS228HesD9g", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rS228HesD9g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Odd Taxi" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "オッドタクシー" }, { "type": "English", "title": "Odd Taxi" }], "title": "Odd Taxi", "title_english": "Odd Taxi", "title_japanese": "オッドタクシー", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2021-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-06-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2021 }, "to": { "day": 29, "month": 6, "year": 2021 } }, "string": "Apr 6, 2021 to Jun 29, 2021" }, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.7, "scored_by": 179497, "rank": 52, "popularity": 564, "members": 365786, "favorites": 7313, "synopsis": "Eccentric and blunt, the walrus Hiroshi Odokawa lives a relatively normal life.

This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.\n\nDue to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.\n\nBullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child.

That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\n\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.\n\nSet in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Samurai Champloo is the only anime to have featured music from the Japanese hip-hop producer Nujabes prior to his death in 2010.

As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.\n\nHowever, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop.

Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section's staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirouta Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.\n\nPlanetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people—people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Planetes is the winner of the 2005 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in science fiction.", "season": "fall", "year": 2003, "broadcast": { "day": "Saturdays", "time": "08:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 08:05 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual" }, { "mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning" }, { "mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama" }, { "mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance" }, { "mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast" }, { "mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space" }, { "mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen" }] }, { "mal_id": 48736, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1179/119897l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "tFKDKd8z-NU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFKDKd8z-NU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFKDKd8z-NU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/tFKDKd8z-NU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/tFKDKd8z-NU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/tFKDKd8z-NU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/tFKDKd8z-NU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/tFKDKd8z-NU/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Sono Kisekae Ningyou wa Koi wo Suru" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "KiseKoi" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "その着せ替え人形は恋をする" }, { "type": "English", "title": "My Dress-Up Darling" }], "title": "Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru", "title_english": "My Dress-Up Darling", "title_japanese": "その着せ替え人形は恋をする", "title_synonyms": ["Sono Kisekae Ningyou wa Koi wo Suru", "KiseKoi"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2022-01-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-03-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 9, "month": 1, "year": 2022 }, "to": { "day": 27, "month": 3, "year": 2022 } }, "string": "Jan 9, 2022 to Mar 27, 2022" }, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.27, "scored_by": 511966, "rank": 275, "popularity": 169, "members": 868191, "favorites": 17892, "synopsis": "High school student Wakana Gojou spends his days perfecting the art of making hina dolls, hoping to eventually reach his grandfather's level of expertise.

As the team prepares for their greatest challenge yet, Sawamura and Furuya carry on their struggle to lead their team to glory and become the star of the game: the true \"Ace of the Diamond.\" \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "spring", "year": 2019, "broadcast": { "day": "Tuesdays", "time": "17:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 17:55 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo" }, { "mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu" }, { "mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon" }, { "mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha" }, { "mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X" }, { "mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production" }], "licensors": [], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School" }, { "mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen" }] }, { "mal_id": 10271, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10271/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji__Hakairoku-hen", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/30599l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": { "image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku-hen" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji S2" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "The Suffering Pariah Kaiji: Backslide Arc" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "逆境無頼カイジ 破戒録篇" }, { "type": "English", "title": "Kaiji: Against All Rules" }, { "type": "German", "title": "Kaiji: Against All Rules" }, { "type": "Spanish", "title": "Kaiji: Against All Rules" }, { "type": "French", "title": "Kaiji: Against All Rules" }], "title": "Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku-hen", "title_english": "Kaiji: Against All Rules", "title_japanese": "逆境無頼カイジ 破戒録篇", "title_synonyms": ["Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji S2", "The Suffering Pariah Kaiji: Backslide Arc"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2011-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2011-09-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2011 }, "to": { "day": 28, "month": 9, "year": 2011 } }, "string": "Apr 6, 2011 to Sep 28, 2011" }, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.25, "scored_by": 99684, "rank": 286, "popularity": 1167, "members": 181675, "favorites": 2573, "synopsis": "Owing to an increasing debt, Kaiji Itou ends up resuming his old lifestyle.

The initial Geneon Entertainment USA (then known as Pioneer) releases on VHS and DVD (singles, Signature Series, and box set) used only the first opening on each episode. This was due to the Japanese licensor providing them clean materials for only the first opening to put the English credits on.

The weariness and regret stemming from the seemingly never-ending war catch up to him, and as he draws his final breath, Kongming wishes that if he were to reincarnate, he would be reborn in a more peaceful era.\n\nHis wish comes true, and Kongming wakes up in modern-day Tokyo with a younger body and his memories intact. Thrust into an unfamiliar world, he finds his way into a nightclub and meets Eiko Tsukimi, an aspiring singer whose performance immediately captivates him. Pitying his confusion, Eiko takes Kongming under her wing and teaches him about the current world, which leads to Kongming's interest in contemporary music. Seeing Eiko's immense musical potential, Kongming vows to make the world recognize her and soon takes on the role of her manager.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the music industry is unforgiving to those who make even the slightest mistakes. Still, Kongming is determined to accomplish his goals—even if he must utilize the war stratagems he famously used in his previous life!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "spring", "year": 2022, "broadcast": { "day": "Tuesdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 23:00 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System" }, { "mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha" }, { "mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures" }, { "mal_id": 1671, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures" }, { "mal_id": 2074, "type": "anime", "name": "Bit grooove promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 132, "type": "anime", "name": "P.A.

As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "winter", "year": 2021, "broadcast": { "day": "Sundays", "time": "00:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:30 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex" }, { "mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix" }, { "mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System" }, { "mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic" }, { "mal_id": 1677, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanetsu Investment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment" }, { "mal_id": 1744, "type": "anime", "name": "My Theater D.D.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1744/My_Theater_DD" }, { "mal_id": 2095, "type": "anime", "name": "Global Solutions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2095/Global_Solutions" }, { "mal_id": 2186, "type": "anime", "name": "Mirai-Kojo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2186/Mirai-Kojo" }], "licensors": [{ "mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation" }], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 1835, "type": "anime", "name": "CloverWorks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School" }], "demographics": [{ "mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen" }] }, { "mal_id": 6811, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6811/InuYasha__Kanketsu-hen", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75570l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "BcAuqVLCsZE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcAuqVLCsZE", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcAuqVLCsZE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcAuqVLCsZE/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcAuqVLCsZE/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcAuqVLCsZE/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcAuqVLCsZE/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcAuqVLCsZE/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Inu Yasha: Kanketsu-hen" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "犬夜叉 完結編" }, { "type": "English", "title": "InuYasha: The Final Act" }, { "type": "German", "title": "InuYasha: The Final Act" }], "title": "InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen", "title_english": "InuYasha: The Final Act", "title_japanese": "犬夜叉 完結編", "title_synonyms": ["Inu Yasha: Kanketsu-hen"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2009-10-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2010-03-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 4, "month": 10, "year": 2009 }, "to": { "day": 30, "month": 3, "year": 2010 } }, "string": "Oct 4, 2009 to Mar 30, 2010" }, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.2, "scored_by": 134848, "rank": 348, "popularity": 809, "members": 266219, "favorites": 2074, "synopsis": "Thwarted again by Naraku, Inuyasha, Kagome Higurashi, and their friends must continue their hunt for the few remaining Shikon Jewel shards, lest they fully form into a corrupted jewel at the hands of Naraku.

The event leaves a deep impression on the girl, Utena Tenjou, leading her to become a prince herself. \n\nYears later, Utena attends Ootori Academy, recognized by the same rose emblem as her precious ring's.

While Utena thinks nothing of the occurrence, the Student Council gathers to discuss an important matter. \n\nSubsequently, a misunderstanding leads to Utena being dragged into the world of Duelists—those with rings similar to her own. The Duelists fight for the ownership of the Rose Bride, Anthy Himemiya, who is said to possess great power. Wanting to prove her capabilities as a prince, and enraged that Anthy is being wronged and objectified, Utena resolves to fight against the Duelists to save her from the cruel fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Childhood idealism, illusions, ambition, adulthood, sexuality, abuse, incest and identity are all prominent themes which are explored in what is essentially a highly metaphorical and symbolic coming-of-age story.

Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past.\n\nThe stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again—using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation—steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "season": "summer", "year": 2022, "broadcast": { "day": "Mondays", "time": "21:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 21:00 (JST)" }, "producers": [{ "mal_id": 101, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Hibari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari" }, { "mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic" }, { "mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X" }, { "mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy" }, { "mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll" }, { "mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House" }, { "mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa" }, { "mal_id": 2425, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Music Live", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live" }], "licensors": [], "studios": [{ "mal_id": 456, "type": "anime", "name": "Lerche", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/456/Lerche" }], "genres": [{ "mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama" }, { "mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense" }], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{ "mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological" }, { "mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School" }], "demographics": [] }, { "mal_id": 37962, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37962/IDOLiSH7_Second_Beat", "images": { "jpg": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361l.jpg" }, "webp": { "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/106361l.webp" } }, "trailer": { "youtube_id": "GFJnHFejErk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFJnHFejErk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFJnHFejErk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": { "image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GFJnHFejErk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GFJnHFejErk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GFJnHFejErk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GFJnHFejErk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GFJnHFejErk/maxresdefault.jpg" } }, "approved": true, "titles": [{ "type": "Default", "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second Beat!" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "IDOLiSH7 2" }, { "type": "Synonym", "title": "Idolish Seven 2" }, { "type": "Japanese", "title": "アイドリッシュセブン Second BEAT!" }, { "type": "English", "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second BEAT!" }, { "type": "German", "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second Beat!" }, { "type": "Spanish", "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second Beat!" }, { "type": "French", "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second Beat!" }], "title": "IDOLiSH7 Second Beat!", "title_english": "IDOLiSH7 Second BEAT!", "title_japanese": "アイドリッシュセブン Second BEAT!", "title_synonyms": ["IDOLiSH7 2", "Idolish Seven 2"], "type": "TV", "source": "Game", "episodes": 15, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": { "from": "2020-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-12-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": { "from": { "day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2020 }, "to": { "day": 27, "month": 12, "year": 2020 } }, "string": "Apr 5, 2020 to Dec 27, 2020" }, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.15, "scored_by": 9112, "rank": 397, "popularity": 3856, "members": 27507, "favorites": 367, "synopsis": "Following their performance at the Black or White event, the idol group IDOLiSH7 is at the height of its popularity, with offers for various concerts and work coming in every day, much to the joy of the seven boys and their manager.

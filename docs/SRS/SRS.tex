\section{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
The business aims to make finding shows across groups of friends with differing preferences easier by streamlining the process from start to finish. As a quick summary, users will be able to input their preferences, make groups with their friends, and the group will get recommendations based on all their preferences. In addition, an opportunity arose in the market after COVID passed as large groups can create host gatherings for any events, one such that this application can select.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Goals can shift as development continues, entirely losing scope on the developers' passion for why the application started. Thus there will only be a few immediate goals to capture the passion that developers currently have and will continue to uphold in the future:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a means of choosing a show to watch immediately in a large friend group, which they all enjoy
	\item Minimize the number of advertisements while using the application
\end{itemize}

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Solution Constraints}
There are no specific constraints the stakeholders have asked to be on the product regarding the solution. So instead, 7eam deems it necessary to have a general form of constraint on the development of Flick Picker that is the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flick Picker must have in-depth tests on any part of the application before releasing it to the users and also follow a strict and healthy software engineering process
\end{itemize}
There are no specific technological constraints. However, the technology stack must follow industry standards.

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
The application will be deployed on a website, so the restrictions of a browser follow.

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
Not Applicable

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The list of Movies, TV Shows, and Animes will be polled from two separate APIs, which is the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GET IT
	\item FROM JARROD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
As Flick Picker is a browser application, 7eam expects users to use the application on their desktops or phones. Thus the application must be optimized for both possible settings, relying on a responsive layout. However, the users' physical workplace has no bearing on the design, as they can use it whenever necessary. 

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
The schedule is the same as the one Dr. Smith has provided us with

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
The expenses for this application must not exceed \$500, and there are only five developers working on 7eam.

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsection{Relevant Facts}
There is no existing solution 7eam has found that fills a similar role as selecting a Movie, TV Show or Anime based on users' preferences in a group.


\subsection{Business Rules}
Not Applicable

\subsection{Assumptions}
There are a few assumptions 7eam deems necessary to see regarding Flick Picker's capabilities and what it will not do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flick Picker will not provide a means to watch the selected show directly through the application
	\item If the group shares no preferences, then the recommendations will be skipping the preferences of some individual
	\item The browser on which the application is used, through any device, is not deprecated
\end{itemize}

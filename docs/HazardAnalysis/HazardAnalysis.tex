\section{Introduction}
Before going any further with system design, it is crucial to conduct a hazard analysis of the system from an engineering perspective. The goal is to identify critical safety concerns the application users could face and the solutions to them. Hazards will be determined using the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for Flick Picker.

\section{Scope and Purpose}
This document covers the various areas in which the system is most vulnerable, including but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item External Resource Integration Points
	\item Server Communication
	\item TODO: Add more here or delete
\end{itemize}
Along with identifying the vulnerable areas of the system, this document also covers the strategies, both elimination and mitigation, and new security requirements to reduce or eliminate the impact that these hazards have.

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
Below are tables containing the full Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.
\begin{table}[hp]

	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{| p{0.2\textwidth} | X X p{0.25\textwidth} X l |}
		\hline
		Component & Failure Modes & Effects of Failure & Causes of Failure & Recommended Actions & SR \\
		\hline
		Database & Data is deleted on accident & All user data is lost & Database Failure & Regular backups exist where data can be rolled back on demand & IR2, IR3 \\
		\hdashline
		~ & Data is unavailable & User cannot access data & Database Failure & Refer Above & IR7 \\
		\hdashline
		~ & Data is modified incorrectly & User data is not updated & Database Failure & System alerts if data is not modified when requested & IR2 \\
		\hline
		Authentication & User cannot login & User cannot view recommendations or friends & Invalid Credentials & Use the correct credentials & AR1, PR1 \\
		\hline
		\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{| p{0.2\textwidth} | X X p{0.25\textwidth} X l |}
		\hline
		Component & Failure Modes & Effects of Failure & Causes of Failure & Recommended Actions & SR \\
		\hline
		Authentication & Impersonated Superadmin manipulates user's database & User data is changed on back-end, or deleted & Database Security Failure & Reset superadmin password and rollback database & AR2 \\
		\hline
		Show Selection & Show selection misses preferences & Group will be given a recommendation which does not match all preferences & Algorithmic Error & Group has to try a new recommendation or modify their preferences as none would match & PR2 \\
		\hdashline
		~ & Show selection takes too long & Group is given recommendations too slowly & Algorithmic Error & Server must be able to handle influx of requests at busy times & PR2 \\

		\hline
		Component & Failure Modes & Effects of Failure & Causes of Failure & Recommended Actions & SR \\

		Browser & Application Crashes & Unsaved user data can be lost & General browser crash & Reopen browser application and fill in any data that was not saved & IR6 \\
		\hline
		Github Automation & Pipeline Not Automatically Run & The current build of will look like it has no issues but the tests were not run & GitHub Error & Manually start pipeline & IR4, IR5 \\

\section{Safety Requirements}
Below are the Requirements that have been formed by the above analysis.

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item AR1: Users can only access and modify their own data
	\item AR2: Only a superadmin can modify the database directly, which there is only one of
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IR1: User data is not modified without their permission
	\item IR2: Database backups occur daily
	\item IR3: Database backups are kept for at minimum one month
	\item IR4: CI/CD Pipeline is run before every deployment to ensure a healthy application state
	\item IR5: CI/CD Pipeline is run on every new code change before it can be merged
	\item IR6: Application crashes will not cause the device to stop working
	\item IR7: Database will be available as long as the service is available
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item PR1: Users have to login with their credentials to access application data
	\item PR2: Algorithm to choose shows shall be protected
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Audit Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item AT1: Requirements shall be easy to read and verify across the system
\end{itemize}

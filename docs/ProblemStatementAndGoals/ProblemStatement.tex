\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}

7eam will be developing a system to enable individuals or groups to find movies, tv shows, or anime that are compatible with an individual or group based on a variety of factors.

Current solutions exist, however, they are mostly catered towards the individual and have lacking support for groups. In order for a user to emulate a group, they would need to figure out what the common likes and dislikes of the group are, the time constraints of each individual, as well as any other important factors that can be inputted. This process is slow and will often cause certain members' preferences to be left out or devalued. 

Flick picker will allow for an individual to find a movie, tv show, or anime that fits their preferences.

Flick picker will allow for a group of individuals to find a movie, tv show, or anime that most closely fits the preferences of the group.


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

Users will input various preferences regarding movies, tv shows, and anime. 

Users will create a group that can consist of one or more people.

Flick Picker will output a set of movies, tv shows, or anime that fits the combined preferences of the group as closely as possible.

\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}

\subsection{Cater to Users' Interests}
Allow for a wide variety of different categories and subcategories that a user may choose, in order that the system may provide a list of relevant recommendations.

\subsection{Find Common Interests}
Find content that meets some common criteria of all users in a group.

\subsection{API Data Collection}
Will obtain all necessary information on shows and movies through API services.

\subsection{Group Compromise}
Should there be no overlapping interests between two or more users in a group, the system will either provide show or movie recommendations that are of a similar 
genre to what was selected (an ”inbetween” solution), use a tie-breaking mechanism (if one set of categories have more popularity in the group), or select options 
from the non-overlapping categories.

\subsection{Web App Compatibility}
Will work on multiple web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, etc. on desktop devices.

\subsection{Create Account and Login}
User will be able to create an account with their saved preferences and account settings that are stored and will persist for future logins.

\section{Stretch Goals}

\subsection{Mobile Web Usability}
System could be optimized for easier use on web browsers for mobile devices.

\subsection{Mobile App}
An app may made available on the Apple and Android stores for download.

\subsection{Login with Other Accounts}
Ability to log on to the system with another account, such as Facebook, Google, or Netflix.

\subsection{Separate Dev and Prod Deployment}
For the purpose of allowing developers to push up code without harming user experience if errors arise from it.

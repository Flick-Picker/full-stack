This document contains the V\&{}V plan for Flick Picker, as well as the roadmap of when the tests will be implemented.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
This document describes the plan to verify and validate that Flick Picker meets the defined requirements and specifications. Additionally, this document will validate that Flick Picker fulfills its intended purpose of recommending compatible Movies, TV Shows, or Anime to an individual or a group.

\subsubsection{Front End Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Account Creation - Web page that facilitates user account creation
	\item User Preferences - Web page that facilitates user preference settings
	\item Group Creation - Web page that facilitates the creation of groups
	\item Recommendation - Web page that displays recommendations for an individual or group
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Back End Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database Access - Accessing the database to find user preferences or information pertaining to Movies, TV Shows, or Anime
	\item Recommendation Algorithm - The algorithm responsible for finding the best Movies, TV Shows, or Anime for an individual or group
	\item API Data - The accessing, storage, and usage of external data from various APIs
\end{itemize}

% \wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}
\subsubsection{Requirements}
The first objective involves verifying that Flick Picker meets requirements outlined in our SRS document and validating that the behaviour present is desirable. This includes the functional requirements (e.g. Authentication Requirements) and the non-functional requirements (e.g. Appearance Requirements). This objective will build confidence in the correctness of Flick Picker along with validating that security and usability standards are met.

\subsubsection{UI Elements}
The second objective of the V\&V document involves the validation of navigability and functionality of UI elements. Each menu described in the 'Front End Testing' section above must be functional for users. Additionally, users must be able to navigate to each page individually. This objective ensures that usability and response time standards are met. 

\subsubsection{External Connections}
The final objective of the V\&V document is to ensure that all external connections of Flick Picker (e.g. APIs, Database) work as intended. This objective ensures that the interoperability of Flick Picker is adequate. 

%\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,'' ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities, just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

% \wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc). You can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be written.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
The tests outlined here will follow the following format:
\paragraph*{Test \#{}: Test Title}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[Control:] FR: Manual or Automated | NFR: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, or Static

	\item[Input:] Input
	\item[Output:] Output
	\item[Derivation:] Test Case Derivation

The execution of the test will be through automated selenium tests for the front-end and an API test library for the back-end.

  survey.}

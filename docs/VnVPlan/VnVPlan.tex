This document contains the V\&{}V plan for Flick Picker, as well as the roadmap of when the tests will be implemented.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
This document describes the plan to verify and validate that Flick Picker meets the defined requirements and specifications. Additionally, this document will validate that Flick Picker fulfills its intended purpose of recommending compatible Movies, TV Shows, or Anime to an individual or a group.

\subsubsection{Front End Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Account Creation - Web page that facilitates user account creation
	\item User Preferences - Web page that facilitates user preference settings
	\item Group Creation - Web page that facilitates the creation of groups
	\item Recommendation - Web page that displays recommendations for an individual or group
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Back End Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database Access - Accessing the database to find user preferences or information pertaining to Movies, TV Shows, or Anime
	\item Recommendation Algorithm - The algorithm responsible for finding the best Movies, TV Shows, or Anime for an individual or group
	\item API Data - The accessing, storage, and usage of external data from various APIs
\end{itemize}

% \wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}
\subsubsection{Requirements}
The first objective involves verifying that Flick Picker meets requirements outlined in our SRS document and validating that the behaviour present is desirable. This includes the functional requirements (e.g. Authentication Requirements) and the non-functional requirements (e.g. Appearance Requirements). This objective will build confidence in the correctness of Flick Picker along with validating that security and usability standards are met.

\subsubsection{UI Elements}
The second objective of the V\&V document involves the validation of navigability and functionality of UI elements. Each menu described in the `Front End Testing' section above must be functional for users. Additionally, users must be able to navigate to each page individually. This objective ensures that usability and response time standards are met. 

\subsubsection{External Connections}
The final objective of the V\&V document is to ensure that all external connections of Flick Picker (e.g. APIs, Database) work as intended. This objective ensures that the interoperability of Flick Picker is adequate. 

%\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,'' ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities, just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

% \wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc). You can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be written.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] SRS: \citet{SRS}
	\item[] MG: \citet{MG}
	\item[] MIS: \citet{MIS}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Plan}

Contains the plan for Flick Picker, going into detail about the team and verification plans

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}
The Verification and Validation Team will consist of Internal (team) and External members.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Team Members:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Ali: Ad-hoc or checklist verification of SRS, Design documents through peer-reviewing. Verification of implementation. For testing, responsible for creating/running frontend unit tests and system tests (Integration, Manual).
		\item Andrew: Ad-hoc or checklist verification of SRS, Design documents through peer-reviewing. Verification of implementation. For testing, responsible for creating/running frontend unit tests and system tests.
		\item Jarrod: Ad-hoc or checklist verification of SRS, Design documents through peer-reviewing. Verification of implementation. For testing, responsible for creating/running backend unit tests and system tests.
		\item Madhi: Ad-hoc or checklist verification of SRS, Design documents through peer-reviewing. Verification of implementation. For testing, responsible for creating/running frontend \& backend unit tests and system tests.
		\item Talha: Ad-hoc or checklist verification of SRS, Design documents through peer-reviewing. Verification of implementation. For testing, responsible for creating/running frontend \& backend unit tests and system tests.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item External Members
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Classmates: Ad-hoc verification of SRS and Design documents.
		\item Course TAs and Instructors: Ad-hoc verification of SRS and Design documents. Ad-hoc verification of the app implementation.
		\item Users: Ad-hoc validation of application.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
For the SRS Verification Plan, an ad-hoc approach will be followed. Teammates will peer-review work done for the SRS to verify whether both the functional and non-functional requirements serve validity. The SRS checklist will be followed prior to the finalization of a revision by a team member. Classmates and instructors will ad-hoc review the Revision 0 of the SRS, again to verify the requirements.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
For the Design Verification Plan, an ad-hoc approach will be followed. Teammates will peer-review work done for the MG and MIS to verify whether both modules and their specification have validity. The MG and MIS checklists will be followed prior to the finalization of a revision by a team member. Classmates and instructors will ad-hoc review the Revision 0 of the MG and MIS, again to verify the modules.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
Our Implementation Verification Plan will mainly consist of system testing and unit testing, as specified in the latter sections of this document. These tests will ensure that our implementation meets the criteria for our functional and non-functional requirements.
Further means of implementation verification will also include code walkthroughs and reviews prior to pull request approvals. Static analysis and code coverage will also be incorporated to ensure that new code is written up-to standards. Verification tools will be explained in the latter sections.


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
Unit tests will be written with a JavaScript unit testing framework called Jest. Jest also produces reports for code coverage metrics. Our code coverage goals include an overall 80\% coverage. A code coverage check will be done for every Pull Request made. Code coverage reports will be monitored to ensure that all functionality is being tested. Integration/system tests will be done with Selenium and Cucumber.js. Cucumber.js also has functionality to produce testing metrics and results. For static analysis and linting, ESLint and AirBnB styling will be utilized. This will ensure uniform coding standards and uncover any potential errors prior to compilation. Auomated code builds, through GitHub/Jenkins, will be present to ensure that every deployment made will not break the application. Refer to Development Plan for indepth details behind the tools:

\citet{DevPlan}


\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
For software validation, our team will host review sessions with target users of our application. During this session, these users will interact with the application and we will record their experiences. Based on the data collected, it will allow us to validate whether our requirements fulfills the goal of our application.

\section{System Test Description}

	\item[Input:] Developer will click on their user profile and test the ability to change settings, as well as view the profile information of other users and ensure they cannot change their settings
	\item[Output:] The Developer's user profile will be changed, with such changes being visible to other users (if the setting was one which can be viewed by others) with the content of other profiles being unchangeable
	\item[Derivation:] Developer will ensure that the user's data is changable, that changes to public information can be viewed by others, that others' settings cannot be changed, and private information cannot be viewed by other users

\paragraph*{Security T 2: Integrity}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Control:] Manual
	\item[Initial State:] System is in the main menu state
	\item[Input:] Developer will change a profile or preference setting
	\item[Output:] After different increments of time after the changes are made (such as immediately, 1 hour, and 24 hours after) the Developer will verify that all the changes made persist and do not revert to a prior state
	\item[Derivation:] This is the best way to verify that information persists and retains its integrity over time, with it being possible to infer future persistence of information after the testing period

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

The two traceability matrices can be found in the Appendix.

\section{Unit Test Description}

%\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
%  selection.}
%\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
%  been completed.}
%
In creating unit tests, we wanted to prioritize those functions of the system that were most important in order that it may work. 
This meant creating tests that covered the essentials and, in some cases, could be mapped onto similar functions (such as the group voting session testing 
results being applicable to individual voting, thereby eliminating the need to test the latter). Tests whose results followed from those of others were not 
included for the sake of brevity.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
%
%\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}
%
M3, M5, M6, and M8 is the scope of the modules tested with unit testing. Each of these modules had functions that were vital to the 
system as a whole, and so they were prioritized for unit testing to speed up the testing process whenever large updates to the source code were made. 
We chose to leave out M4 (the Friends Module) since the creation of new test users and adding them as friends was a feature that could easily be verified 
manually and, if something was wrong with it, would be covered by the tests for the Groups Module. Similarly, M9 (OAuth Module) was left out of the scope 
since its functionality relied on what is provided by Google and Meta. Finally, M10 (API Module) was also left out of the scope since it, too, was dependent 
on what is provided by the API developers.


\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
%
%\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}
%
\subsubsection{Module 3 - Native Login}
%
%\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%  tests were selected.}
%
The most important function of this module is the creation of new accounts, with their data being uploaded to the database, thereby making 
the functionality of logging in inferrable from the success of this unit test.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[]{T1: User Creation\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Login Page

Input: Test email and password

Output: New user profile created and added to database

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the user creation funcationality works

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (user.test.ts)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 5 - Groups}

The funcationality of the Groups Module was fully covered by testing the creation of a group and all funcationality surrounding the adding of new members.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[]{T2: Create a group\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Create Group Page

Input: Test group name

Output: New group is created

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that users can successfully create new groups

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (group.test.ts)

\item[]{T3: Add user to group\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Social Page

Input: Group name and user id/email

Output: varification that selected user has been added to group

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that users can successfully be added to groups

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (group.test.ts)

\item[]{T4: Invite a user to group\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Social Page

Input: Group name and friend id/email

Output: New user recieves invite to test group

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that users can successfully invite new members to groups

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (group.test.ts)

\item[]{T5: Accept Invite to group\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Join Group Page

Input: Group invite id

Output: User accepts the group invite

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that users can successfully accept invitations to new groups

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (group.test.ts)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 6 - Profile}
%
%\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%  tests were selected.}
%
The changes to the profile section all used similar functionality with Firebase, so we thought it only necessary to test the creation of a 
new username. Moreover, the preferenes were fully tested, with initial and later preference changes being accounted for.
\begin{enumerate}

\item[]{T6: Edit user profile\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Change User Name Page

Input: New user profile name

Output: Newly entered profile name is saved and displays instead of email or previous profile name

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the user can successfully change their profile name

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (user.test.ts)

\item[]{T7: New preferences for a user\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Preferences Page

Input: Set of media preferences

Output: Creation of the user's first set of preferences

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the user can successfully create their initial preferences

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (user.test.ts)

\item[]{T8: Edit user preferences\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Preferences Page

Input: Set of media preferences

Output: Change the user's first set of preferences to the newly specified preferences

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the user can successfully change their preferences

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (user.test.ts)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 8 - Matching Algorithm}

The matching algorithm was fully tested, with the voting session, recommendations, votes, and final suggestion all being accounted for.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[]{T9: Start a Voting Session\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Group Page

Input: Group id

Output: New voting session for test group

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the group can start a new voting session

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (recommendation.test.ts)

\item[]{T10: Load Recommendations\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Group Voting Page

Input: Group and session id

Output: Recommendations for the group

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the algorithm can generate recommendations based on the preferences of all members

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (recommendation.test.ts)

\item[]{T11: Submit Votes\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Group Voting Page

Input: Session id and votes for suggested media

Output: Verification that the users' votes are saved

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the system can save users' votes for different media

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (recommendation.test.ts)

\item[]{T12: Find Best Match\\}

Type: Automatic

Output: The media that the algorithm chooses based on preferences and votes

Test Case Derivation: Ensure that the algorithm can provide a decision based on the suggestions and votes

How test will be performed: automatic testing file (recommendation.test.ts)

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
There were no nonfunctional unit tests, as all nonfunctional requirements were tested through different means (such as the survey, as seen in the Appendix).

%
%\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
%  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}
%
%\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
%  mentioned functional tests.}

%
\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Modules}

%\wss{Provide evidence that all of the modules have been considered.}
